# ConQ_Unity_2018_Editor
A range of useful editor scripts for Unity 2018

## Material Duplicator:
A script that duplicates selected materials and allows you to save the new material under a custom name. Ideally used when multiple materials use the same maps for example. [MaterialDuplicator](https://github.com/ConQode/ConQ_Unity_2018_Editor/blob/main/Assets/Editor/MaterialDuplicator.cs)

## Multiply Positions By 9:
A script that multiplies the position values of selected objects by 9. Useful when child objects need to be scaled up, to fit the scale of a parent object. [MultiplyPositionsBy9](https://github.com/ConQode/ConQ_Unity_2018_Editor/blob/main/Assets/Editor/MultiplyPositionsBy9.cs)

## Create Prefab From Selection:
A script that creates prefabs from all selected objects in the hierarchy. Make sure the objects are unpacked and the target folder is selected in the project window. [CreatePrefabFromSelection](https://github.com/ConQode/ConQ_Unity_2018_Editor/blob/main/Assets/Editor/CreatePrefabFromSelection.cs)

## ScaleChildren:
A script to scale up the first generation of children of an selected object, by the factor 9. [ScaleChildren](https://github.com/ConQode/ConQ_Unity_2018_Editor/blob/main/Assets/Editor/ScaleChildren.cs)
